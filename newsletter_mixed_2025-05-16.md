**Summary:** 
Jonathan Mills, founder of Hashling NFT and a Bitcoin mining venture, is being sued by former business partners for allegedly misappropriating millions of dollars and not distributing promised equity returns. Mills is accused of transferring assets and at least $3 million to his holding company, Satoshi Labs LLC, without consent and then disappearing. The lawsuit accuses Mills of fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, and the plaintiffs are seeking a constructive trust over the projectâ€™s assets and full legal restitution. Despite these controversies, Bitcoin's role as a global inflation hedge remains strong, even as the market sees a shift in ownership from retail to institutional investors.
