**Summary:** 
Bitcoin's price dropped nearly 3% amid a public dispute between U.S. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, leading to the liquidation of approximately $308 million in long positions. The feud escalated when Musk criticized Trump's global tariff plans, predicting a potential recession, which led Trump to propose ending government subsidies to Musk's companies. Bitcoin had recently hit a new all-time high of $111,970, but faced selling pressure from long-term holders, increasing the likelihood of a short-term correction. Other major cryptocurrencies also saw declines, with Ether dropping 7.25%, and the total crypto market experiencing nearly $982.55 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours.

This movement underscores the market's recognition of NEAR's utility and resilience, positioning it as a strong contender in the blockchain infrastructure space.

### RWA Token Market Soars 260% to $23 Billion by 2025
**Source:** [https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/684172ca953a4846fe1299df/](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/684172ca953a4846fe1299df/)

**Summary:** 
In 2025, the market for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) has seen a remarkable 260% growth, reaching a valuation of over $23 billion. This growth is largely attributed to the United States providing clearer regulatory guidelines, particularly around crypto assets and stablecoins, with tokenized private credit and U.S. Treasury debt leading the market shares. The evolving regulatory landscape, including new guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and potential comprehensive rules under the GENIUS Act, has instilled a sense of stability and confidence among investors. The integration of blockchain technology into corporate financial strategies and the growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin have further fueled the demand for tokenized assets.

**Summary:** 
Ethereum ETFs are experiencing a significant surge in investor interest, marked by consistent inflows over the past ten trading sessions, contrasting sharply with Bitcoin ETFs which have seen substantial outflows. BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has been a major beneficiary, with inflows reaching $70.2 million recently, contributing to a total of over $4.6 billion since its inception. Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s IBIT and Ark Invest’s ARKB, have faced significant outflows, totaling $616 million in just the last session. This shift comes even as Ethereum's price shows robust performance, with potential targets set above $4,000, further fueled by a trillion-dollar security upgrade.
