Since starting its Bitcoin accumulation in April 2024, Metaplanet's stock price has surged by over 3,000%, indicating strong investor confidence.

**Summary:** 
Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana have seen significant gains, with Bitcoin increasing by 2.7% to trade around $86,500, Solana jumping 6% to $138, and XRP rising 2.5% to $2.44. The market's positive reaction is attributed to a softened tariff outlook, but analysts warn that unexpected changes or a tougher stance from Trump could cause instability. Two major events are being closely watched by investors: the Senate Banking Committee's questioning of SEC nominee Paul Atkins and Comptroller of the Currency nominee Jonathan Gould on March 27, and the Fed's key inflation report on March 29. Arthur Hayes predicts Bitcoin could hit $110K before a pullback to $76.5K, driven by the Fed's shift from tightening to easing.
