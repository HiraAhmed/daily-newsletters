### Amid Market Uncertainty, Arthur Hayes Pinpoints Bitcoin's Key Support Level
**Source:** [https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/67dc00c6530bfa5202346019/](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/67dc00c6530bfa5202346019/)

**Summary:** 
Arthur Hayes, ex-BitMEX CEO, suggests Bitcoin may have found a support level at $77,000 and could enter a new phase if the Federal Reserve eases Quantitative Tightening (QT) in April. Hayes stresses the need for reinstating the Bank System Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption or restarting quantitative easing (QE) to initiate a new Bitcoin upward trend. He predicts further declines in stock markets and hints at a faster recovery for the cryptocurrency market if Bitcoin maintains the $77,000 support level.
    
### SUI ETF Application Submitted by Canary Capital
**Source:** [https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/67d962756dc77e1ce12d8251/](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/67d962756dc77e1ce12d8251/)

**Summary:** 
Canary Capital has filed an application with the SEC for the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) linked to Sui, potentially broadening institutional access to this digital asset. Despite the precedent set by Bitcoin ETFs, gaining SEC approval remains a challenge, with the listing exchange and regulatory compliance being significant factors. Competition is high with VanEck and 21 Shares also filing for ETFs on Solana and XRP. If approved, the SUI ETF could provide institutional recognition for Sui and promote broader adoption.
    
### Stablecoins Amplify Expectations for Market Upswing

**Summary:** 
The increase in stablecoin supplies indicates a healthier cryptocurrency market and suggests an increase in purchasing capacity among investors. This contrasts with the March 2024 correction phase when a decrease in stablecoin reserves led to market stagnation. CryptoQuant insights suggest that the ongoing correction may be brief and a robust recovery is on the horizon, reinforcing the belief that the market is still on an upward trajectory.
