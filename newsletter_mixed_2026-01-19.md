Gold reached a record high of $4,690 as investors sought safe havens amid market volatility triggered by new tariffs on Greenland. Bitcoin's value plunged below $93,000, reigniting debates about its role as a digital safe haven.

Schiff also predicted that altcoins could become even more worthless than the USD, while an Elliott Wave analysis indicated potential troubles ahead for XRP.

This trend reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin as a stable investment option and marks a pivotal evolution in the market dynamics of cryptocurrencies. SEC Chair Gary Gensler's cautionary remarks highlight the regulatory scrutiny still surrounding these investment vehicles. The increasing accessibility and stabilization of Bitcoin through regulated channels like ETFs suggest a maturing market that could lead to broader adoption and deeper integration into mainstream financial portfolios.

**Summary:** 
The expansion of the CLARITY Act to prohibit yield on stablecoins has sparked debate among industry leaders, who argue that such restrictions could undermine the competitiveness of the U.S. dollar against China's Digital Yuan. The People’s Bank of China's move to introduce yield opportunities for digital currency deposits could make the Digital Yuan more attractive globally. Critics argue that the U.S. policy could stifle innovation and diminish the country's influence in the digital currency market, while regulators defend the measures as necessary to protect the traditional financial system and maintain stability.

**Summary:** 
The stalling of the CLARITY Act in the U.S. Congress could prevent overregulation that might negatively affect decentralized finance (DeFi) and other crypto markets. Market analyst Michaël van de Poppe and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong have highlighted risks of the current bill, including a de facto ban on tokenized stocks, government access to user records on DeFi platforms, and a prohibition on yield-bearing stablecoins. Coinbase's withdrawal of support for the bill has led the White House to consider dropping its support, although negotiations continue to draft a bill that addresses the needs of the crypto industry and community banks.
