**Source:** [https://cointelegraph.com/news/ecb-stablecoin-shock-monetary-policy-risk-2025?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ecb-stablecoin-shock-monetary-policy-risk-2025?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound)

**Summary:** 
Dutch central bank governor Olaf Sleijpen warns of potential macroeconomic risks posed by stablecoins, especially those pegged to the dollar, due to their rapid growth and potential systemic importance to Europe's financial ecosystem. Instability in stablecoins could lead to widespread financial instability and affect inflation rates, possibly forcing the European Central Bank (ECB) to reconsider its monetary policy. The market cap for stablecoins is predicted to reach $2 trillion by 2028, with major stablecoins like USDT and USDC seeing substantial increases. Regulatory bodies and financial authorities across Europe are expressing concern over the influence of dollar-backed stablecoins, with discussions around the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to preserve monetary sovereignty within the eurozone.

**Source:** [https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/691ad852532680768ffbb2e0/](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/691ad852532680768ffbb2e0/)

**Summary:** 
Bitcoin's market behavior has shifted, moving away from its traditional correlation with gold and aligning more closely with US tech stocks, influenced by a $340 billion drop in market capitalization. Bitcoin now mirrors trends seen during the Federal Reserve's 2018 tightening cycle, reflecting broader financial market dynamics and the impact of global liquidity stress. Bitcoin is increasingly reacting to the same factors that affect the tech sector, including fiscal policies and market sentiment, which could alter investment strategies and the asset's role in investment portfolios.

**Source:** [https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/691ad01eedd6293abe8a8656/](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/691ad01eedd6293abe8a8656/)

**Summary:** 
Bitcoin has broken through a crucial support level at $100,266, signaling a potential further drop if it breaches the $93,000 to $95,000 range, with a possible decline towards $89,600 if current supports fail. The market's struggle is compounded by a liquidity crunch and low trading volumes, making a short-term recovery challenging. Factors such as outflows from ETFs, a potential death cross in technical indicators, and uncertainty in U.S. economic data are contributing to the bearish outlook. The upcoming release of FOMC minutes and new economic data following the U.S. government shutdown are anticipated to be critical for setting future market sentiments.

**Summary:** 
Significant outflows from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have been observed, with Bitcoin experiencing a $1.11 billion reduction and Ethereum seeing $728.57 million in outflows. In contrast, altcoins such as Solana and XRP are witnessing inflows, suggesting a potential shift in investor sentiment and strategy. This movement could be interpreted as either a tactical rotation by investors seeking short-term profits from undervalued assets or a strategic realignment towards diversifying portfolios away from the traditionally dominant cryptocurrencies. The increasing interest in altcoins might reflect their perceived potential and underestimation in the market, possibly signaling a broader trend of diversification within cryptocurrency investment strategies.

**Source:** [https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/691a9db8cf1571058d51a8f8/](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/691a9db8cf1571058d51a8f8/)

**Summary:** 
Harvard University has tripled its investment in Bitcoin by acquiring a $443 million stake in the IBIT ETF, despite this still representing less than 1% of Harvard's total endowment. The choice of a regulated, exchange-traded Bitcoin ETF over direct cryptocurrency holdings indicates a cautious yet optimistic approach to digital currency investment. Harvard's investment places it among the top 16 holders of IBIT and signals a growing acceptance and recognition of cryptocurrencies' potential by traditional financial entities. This could potentially influence other large institutional investors to explore similar ventures, thereby impacting the broader dynamics of cryptocurrency adoption and market stability.
