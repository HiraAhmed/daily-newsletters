**Summary:** 
The $TRUMP token experienced a significant drop, trading around $7.73 by late Monday, due to a major sell-off from a key whale investor. Analysts predict that an impending supply increase could further strain the token’s already weak price performance. The coin’s fundamentals have been criticized for relying more on Donald Trump’s political persona than any solid technical or utility backing. Despite previous gains during Trump-related headlines, the token has failed to respond to recent social media activity from the former president, leaving some holders disillusioned.
