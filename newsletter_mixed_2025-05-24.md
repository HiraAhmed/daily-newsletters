**Summary:** 
Bitcoin has surpassed Amazon to become the world's fifth-largest asset by market capitalization, driven by a surge in market cap following substantial inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, such as BlackRockâ€™s IBIT. Bitcoin's price briefly reached $108,954 before experiencing a slight correction. This historic rise places Bitcoin among the ranks of the world's most valuable assets, including gold and major corporations like Microsoft and Apple. Bitcoin's success has been facilitated by the success of Bitcoin ETFs, which have enhanced price discovery and further investment. Despite this progress, Bitcoin's price remains volatile, influenced by various market dynamics and external factors. This milestone underscores the broader trend of cryptocurrency's integration into the mainstream financial system, highlighting its rapid evolution and the increasing recognition of digital assets as legitimate components of a diversified investment portfolio.

**Summary:** 
The ETHBTC pair continues its downward trajectory, causing many alternative cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, to struggle despite Bitcoin reaching new heights. Market expert Faibik suggests that the altcoin bull market is still in its nascent stages and advises traders to hold onto their altcoins. Faibik predicts a potential increase in the altcoin market cap by over 100% and believes that several altcoins may soon revisit their record prices. Analyst Sherpa recommends closely monitoring price fluctuations and order books in shorter time frames to enhance trading decisions. Potential short-term consolidation phases and breakout opportunities, particularly for POPCAT, should be closely monitored. The current crypto market cycle differs from past cycles, with decreasing exchange balances and the introduction of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). The introduction of ETFs may alter traditional market dynamics and provide a new gateway for retail investors, signaling a shift in how investors approach the cryptocurrency markets.

**Summary:** 
Kraken, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, is launching a global tokenized stock trading service using Solana's blockchain. This initiative aims to offer tokenized versions of over 50 U.S. stocks to international investors, enhancing transparency and innovation in financial services. Kraken is partnering with Solana and Backed Finance, which will hold the shares backing the tokenized assets, to facilitate 24/7 trading, reduce brokerage fees, and potentially increase the value of Solana due to heightened network activity. The service targets a diverse global audience, including regions like Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia, thereby expanding the accessibility of U.S. stocks. Kraken is actively working with regulators to navigate the complex landscape of financial compliance. This strategic move could position Kraken as a formidable competitor to traditional brokerages and foster broader adoption of blockchain technology in conventional financial markets.
