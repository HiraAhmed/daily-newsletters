**Summary:** 
Bitcoin is nearing its all-time high, reaching $122,000 after a 5% increase at the start of the week, largely due to a policy allowing retirement savings plans to invest in cryptocurrencies. This policy has notably boosted Bitcoin ETFs with a record inflow of $403.9 million in a single day. Analysts predict Bitcoin could hit $130,000 soon, backed by post-halving year trends and bullish chart signals like the 'Golden Cross'. Rising inflation expectations, increased trading activity, and rising open interest in Bitcoin futures suggest a strong market sentiment for significant growth in Bitcoin's value.
